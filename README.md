The Student ID Generator is a custom-developed Moodle local plugin designed to automate the generation and printing of student ID cards using data stored in user profile custom fields. Tailored for institutions that require a seamless ID management solution, the plugin leverages Moodle's native functionality to provide a secure and efficient process for creating standardized student identification cards.

âœ… Key Features
Custom Field Integration:
Pulls data directly from Moodle's user profile custom fields, such as Student Number, Program, Faculty, Admission Year, and more.

Automated ID Generation:
Generates unique student ID numbers based on configurable patterns (e.g., NDU-2025-00123), incorporating elements like year of admission and faculty codes.

ID Card Design & Printing:
Uses built-in PDF rendering libraries (such as TCPDF) to generate well-designed, printable ID cards. Each card includes:

Student name and photo

ID number

Course or department

QR code or barcode for verification

Institutional branding (logo, colors)

Bulk ID Generation:
Supports filtering by course, cohort, or user role, allowing administrators to generate multiple IDs in a single batch.

User-Friendly Interface:
Accessible via Site administration > Users > ID Generator, with an intuitive UI for selecting students, previewing cards, and exporting PDFs.

Security & Role Management:
Access is restricted to authorized roles such as administrators or registrar staff. All generation activities are optionally logged for auditing purposes.
